ETL Pipeline (Anonymized)
This repository contains a fully anonymized ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline implemented in Python, designed for secure public sharing. The code demonstrates best practices for data ingestion, transformation, validation, and loading using SQL Server and API sources, with all sensitive identifiers replaced by generic placeholders.

Features
Data Ingestion: Fetches data from CSV files, REST APIs, and SQL Server databases.
Bulk and Incremental Loading: Supports both bulk and incremental data loads with schema validation and status tracking.
Transformation Logic: Applies mapping, validation, and transformation scripts to stage data for further processing.
Multi-Stage Data Movement: Moves data across multiple stages (Stage1, Stage2, Stage3) with options for incremental and bulk operations.
Mapping Validators: Validates mapping tables and checks for unexpected values using customizable SQL queries.
Data Summary Generation: Produces summary statistics and metrics for key tables, saving results to text files.
Automated Test Cases: Runs comprehensive test cases to validate ETL logic, schema, joins, and mapping validity.
Logging: Implements robust logging for debugging and audit trails.
Anonymization: All table names, column names, API endpoints, and server/database details are replaced with generic sequential names (e.g., Table_01, Col_01, API_BASE_URL, SERVER_NAME).
Structure
Notebook Cells: Each cell contains either a function definition, transformation script, or documentation for a specific ETL step.
Main Pipeline: Orchestrates the entire ETL process, including data retrieval, transformation, loading, and validation.
Reusable Functions: Modular functions for reading data, connecting to databases, loading data, transforming, and validating.
Usage
Configure your environment with the required Python packages (e.g., pandas, SQLAlchemy, pyodbc, requests).
Replace placeholder credentials and connection strings with your own secure values.
Run the notebook step-by-step or execute the main pipeline cell to process your data end-to-end.
Security & Sharing
All sensitive information has been anonymized for safe public sharing.
The logic and structure remain intact, making this notebook a useful template for ETL pipeline development and demonstration.
